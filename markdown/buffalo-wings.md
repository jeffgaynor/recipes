## Description

Oven-Baked Buffalo Wings! Here's an easier and less messy way to make Buffalo Wings. Marinate your wings in a spicy sauce, broil them briefly, then serve with a tangy blue cheese sauce.

## Ingredients

##### For the wings:

- 2 pounds chicken wings (about 12 wings)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 4 tablespoons bottled hot pepper sauce (like Crystal or Frank's Original)
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

##### For the blue cheese dip:

- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or white vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced

##### To serve:

- Celery sticks (optional)

## Directions

#### 1. Prepare wings

Cut off wing tips (discard or reserve for other use such as making stock). Cut wings at the joint. Put chicken wing pieces in a large bowl. Set aside.

Food safety note: when cutting raw chicken it is best to use a cutting board reserved just for cutting raw chicken. Wash thoroughly when finished. Do not let raw chicken juices come in contact with other food.

#### 2. Prepare marinade

Create a marinade by stirring together the melted butter, hot pepper sauce, paprika, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper in a large bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons of the marinade and set aside (you will use to coat the wings after they come out of the oven).

#### 3. Marinate the wings

Add the chicken wings to the bowl with the marinade and toss to coat all of the wings with the marinade. Let the chicken wings marinate at room temperature for half an hour.

#### 4. Broil the wings

Remove the wings from the marinade (discard the marinade) and place them on the rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat for about 10 minutes on each side, until chicken is tender and no longer pink.

#### 5. Prepare the blue cheese dip:

While the wings are cooking, place the sour cream, blue cheese, mayonnaise, vinegar, and garlic in a blender and pulse until smooth. Cover and chill. (Dip will last up to a week.)

#### 6 Baste the wings with reserved marinade

Remove the chicken wings from oven and baste with the 2 tablespoons of reserved marinade (not the marinade that was in contact with the raw chicken).

Serve with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks.
