## Ingredients

##### For the cream cheese filling version:

- 12 jalapeño peppers (see Recipe Note)
- 1/4 cup minced onion
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 3/4 cup cream cheese
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)
- 2 ounces jack cheese, cut into 2 1/2-inch long batons

##### For the bacon and jack cheese filling version:

- 12 jalapeño peppers (see Recipe Note)
- 1/4 cup chopped cooked bacon
- 1/4 cup minced onion
- 1/2 cup shredded jack cheese, plus another 2 ounces of jack cheese cut into 2 1/2-inch long batons
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano

## Directions

#### 1. Preheat the oven to 375°F

#### 2. Prepare the jalapeños for stuffing

You can either slice the jalapeños in half lengthwise or you can slice off the top one-third (lengthwise) of each jalapeño to make a boat shape out of each pepper. The halved jalapeños will go further (twice as many stuffed peppers), but you can put more filling into the boat-shaped peppers. Your choice. If you choose to make the boats, you can mince the tops and add them to the filling if you want some extra heat, or save them for another recipe. In either case, scrape out all the seeds and ribs from each jalapeño with a spoon (a grapefruit spoon works great). Stuffed Jalapenos scrape out the seeds

#### 3. Mix

Mix together all the filling ingredients except the jack cheese batons.

#### 4. Stuff the jalapeños

Pack the filling into the peppers and nestle a baton of jack cheese onto the filling of each one.

#### 5. Bake

Arrange the peppers on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 375°F for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, and the peppers are cooked.

Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
